## ðŸŽ¤ Presentation Tips

### **Before the Demo**
1. **Test all features** to ensure they work smoothly
2. **Prepare backup responses** for common questions
3. **Have the application running** and ready
4. **Clear browser cache** for fresh appearance

### **During the Demo**
1. **Speak clearly** and at a good pace
2. **Highlight technical achievements** as you demonstrate
3. **Show confidence** in your implementation
4. **Be prepared for questions** about technical details

### **Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: How does the RAG system work?**
*A: Our RAG system combines vector search with LLM integration. When a user asks a question, we generate embeddings, search our vector database for relevant context, and then use an LLM to generate a contextual response.*

**Q: What makes this different from a regular chatbot?**
*A: Unlike regular chatbots, our system uses real-world data from multiple sources, performs semantic search to find relevant information, and provides context-aware responses with confidence scoring.*

**Q: How scalable is this architecture?**
*A: The async architecture and vector database design allow for high throughput. We can easily scale by adding more workers and expanding our vector collections.*

**Q: What's the accuracy of the responses?**
*A: Our confidence scoring system shows 0.85-0.95 confidence for high-quality responses, and the RAG system ensures responses are based on real, up-to-date data.*
